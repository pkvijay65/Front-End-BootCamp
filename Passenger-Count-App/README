So, this was my first scrim using JavaScript (yaay!) and I'd say it's pretty cool!
Anyways, here is what I learnt during this scrim:
1. script tag 
2. variables in js
3. numbers
4. strings
5. console.log and its role in debugging
6. functions
7. the DOM
8. getElementbyId()
9. innerText vs textContent
